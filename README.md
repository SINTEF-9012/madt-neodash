```

Make sure chart.js, react-chartjs-2 and cl-react-graph are installed, if not, use:

```
yarn add chart.js, react-chartjs-2, cl-react-graph
```

Build local Docker image for MQtt-Kafka bridge (the rest of the Docker images are pulled from web):

```
docker build -t mqtt-kafka-bridge -f docker/Dockerfile .
```

Navigate to the `statistics` directory and build the Dockerfile for the statistics module:

```
docker build -t statistics -f Dockerfile .
```

Create an environment and install Python (v3.10), flask (v3.0.0), minio (v7.1.17), neo4j (v5.15.0), poetry (v1.7.1), openai (v0.28.1), pyyaml (v6.0.1), strenum (v0.4.15), dpkt (v1.9.8), influxdb-client (v1.42.0) and paho-mqtt (v1.6.1) OR use connection/environment.yml file to create Conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
To verify installation: 
```
conda env list
```

## Setup

Launch databases in docker:

```
docker compose up
```

Run in another terminal:

```
yarn run dev
```

Activate the environment, navigate to the connection folder and run `minio_api.py`, `neo4j_api.py`, `influxdb_api.py` and `analytics_api.py` files, using the following commands:

```
python minio_api.py
python neo4j_api.py
python analytics_api.py
python influxdb_api.py
```

Navigate to the `statistics` directory, and run the following command (after having started the rest of the services as explained above):

```
docker run -p 5003:5003 --network=sindit_network -it statistics
```

### Accessing Database and Dashboard

Open the minio database in browser: [http://localhost:9099](http://localhost:9099).
Log in with user name and password (detailed in docker compose file).

Create a user and set the policy to read-write. The access and secret keys need to be updated in the `connection/minio_config.ini` file, and in `statistics/minio_config.ini`.
Create a bucket and update the bucket name in `connection/minio_api.py` file. Add the PCAP file to the bucket. 

Open the neo4j database in browser: [http://localhost:7474](http://localhost:7474).
Log in with user name and password (detailed in docker compose file).

Open the dashboard in browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), choose "New Dashboard". 
Log in with user name and password (detailed in docker compose file).

**Create database**: If the database is empty, you can load one by opening Neo4j Browser at [http://localhost:7474](http:localhost:7474). Copy the content from `samples/<latest-date-sample>.cypher` and past it into the query box of the Neo4j browser, then execute the query. The name/type of the PCAP file needs to correspond to the endpoint/type properties of the static node. 

**Load dashboard**: To load a dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), press load dashboard button in left side panel. Choose "Select from file", and choose a sample dashboard (e.g. `samples/dashboard-<latest-date>.json`).
